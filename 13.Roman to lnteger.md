Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

There are six instances where subtraction is used:
```
IV = 4
IX = 9
XL = 40
XC = 90
CD = 400
CM = 900
```

## My solution
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
```
XII=12
